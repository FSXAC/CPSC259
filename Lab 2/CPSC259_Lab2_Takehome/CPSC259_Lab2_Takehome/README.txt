The output of our program is compared thoroughly with the expected results given to us.
We ran the program through the three tests: "perfect_match", "short_sample", and "long_sample",
the results of our program matched perfectly with the expected.

The challenges include making sure we are not looking at wrong memory location, so part of our
effort is to ensure that all operations are dereferenced properly. Another challenge is debugging,
since we're working with pointers, it was harder to debug to see if there was certain part of the
code that caused dereferencing places that are "out of bound".

We spent a collective of about 4 hours on this lab. With roughly 50%/50% contribution.
