Details about testing for correctness:
Program was ran through the given test cases and made sure that all results,
including number of paths, shortest paths, and cheapest paths are taken

Challenges:
Initially, I made a small mistake of passing in global variable 'paths' to the recursive
'generate_all_paths' function which threw some pretty nasty errors. And I blamed on the
'realloc' functions since I didn't really know how to use them. To overcome this, we just
had to proof read our code a bunch of times.
