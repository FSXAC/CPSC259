Tested for correctness:
Program was tested with multiple versions of web.txt randomly generated by another program. We then ran through the same web link matrix in this program and MATLAb to ensure we get the same result. And we did.

Challenges:
One thing that was a bit annoying is column-major vs row-major. Initially this was giving us a lot of non-sense results, But we quickly figured out by just transposing in MATLAB using (')

Hours:
2 hours each
