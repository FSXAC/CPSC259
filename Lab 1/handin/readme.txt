Since we did not have to write the math function, testing the program's correctness is straight forward. We carefully reviewed every lines of code and make sure it followed the parameters exactly as indicated in the comments. 
Max. frequency is printed everytime a new maximum frequency is found, which helped us make sense out of the program as it should get the maximum values near the end of the loop (center of the entire array).

Challenging part is actually trying to understand everything that's already in the code before we even begin writing. We overcame those challenges by extensively reading all documentation and comments to make sure we knew EXACTLY what the program is doing.
